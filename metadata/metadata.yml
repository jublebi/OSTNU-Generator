name: 'Version [5.0]- [CSTNU Tool: A Java Library for Checking Temporal Networks]'
description: "CSTNU Tool is a Java library for representing and checking different
  kinds of temporal constraint networks. \nIn particular, CSTNU Tool  offers an optimized
  implementation of \nsome constraint-propagation algorithms to check the dynamic
  controllability (DC) of \n'Conditional Simple Temporal Networks (CSTNs)',\n'Conditional
  Simple Temporal Networks with Uncertainty (CSTNUs)', and\n'Flexible Simple Temporal
  Networks with Uncertainty (FTNUs)'.\nThe optimization is with respect to the management
  of labeled values that are present in conditional and flexible networks. \n\nThe
  library offers also a simple GUI application to build\\slash manage and check temporal
  networks in an intuitive way, and some Java programs for generating random temporal
  networks according to some input parameters."
